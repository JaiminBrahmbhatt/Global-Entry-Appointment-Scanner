# Global-Entry-Appointment-Scanner
Simple python script that scans for next available appointment for global entry

# Prerequistics 
1. Finding the location Id of your location
2. Go to - https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/schedulerapi/locations and look for nearest airports and fetch the "id"
3. Locally installed python dev environment

# How to run
1. If you want to get text messages for when the appointment is available use Twillio API to send yourself SMS
2. If you have time to look at your screen just run it locally while commenting out twillio api code
3. All the packages used are inbuilt so you will just need python dev environment that run the code for you

Thank you to these two amazing folks for the inspiration -
